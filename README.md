Sequential Search &amp; Binary Search Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental search algorithms in Java: 
**Sequential Search** and **Binary Search**. These algorithms demonstrate basic techniques for searching elements within an array, with detailed code and explanations.

## Features:
### Sequential Search:
- Linear search algorithm for unsorted or sorted arrays.
- Simple implementation with step-by-step element checking.

### Binary Search:
- Efficient algorithm for sorted arrays.
- Demonstrates the divide-and-conquer approach to find elements.
